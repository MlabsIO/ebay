# Ebay API keys
- Firstly, create an account at https://developer.ebay.com/ using your ebay.com username / password of your choosing.
- Once your developer account is approved (24-48 hrs), go to https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys and create a production keyset. In this keyset you will find your AppID, CertID, and DevID. 
- Next go to https://developer.ebay.com/my/auth?env=production&index=0, and retrieve an Auth'n'Auth key upon logging into your ebay account. This key serves as your AuthID.
- With these keys, fill in ebay-config.json. You are done setting the script up and are now ready to go ahead and launch it.
